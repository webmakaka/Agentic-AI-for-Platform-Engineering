# Chapter 05: Building an AI-Powered Backstage Platform

This chapter walks through setting up a Backstage internal developer portal and progressively enhancing it with an AI chat assistant, catalog awareness, and Kubernetes integration — all in four incremental labs.

## Labs

### [Lab 1: Setting Up Backstage with GitOps](./1-backstage-setup/)

Creates a Backstage application from scratch with GitHub integration and ArgoCD for GitOps. Includes a Web App template that scaffolds Kubernetes manifests and opens a pull request — merging it triggers an automatic deployment via ArgoCD.

### [Lab 2: Adding the AI Chat Assistant](./2-add-chat-assistant/)

Installs the [GenAI Plugin](https://github.com/awslabs/backstage-plugins-for-aws/tree/main/plugins/genai) and wires up an AI-powered chat interface in the Backstage sidebar. At this stage the assistant answers general questions using AWS Bedrock (or OpenAI) but has no access to catalog data yet.

### [Lab 3: Adding Backstage Catalog Actions](./3-add-catalog-actions/)

Gives the chat assistant read access to the Backstage software catalog and TechDocs by registering three built-in actions: `get-catalog-entity`, `search-catalog`, and `search-techdocs`. No extra packages required — just configuration.

### [Lab 4: Adding Kubernetes MCP Actions](./4-add-kubernetes-actions/)

Adds four custom `kubectl` actions (`kubectl_get_pods`, `kubectl_get_deployments`, `kubectl_get_services`, `kubectl_describe_pod`) so the assistant can query live cluster state directly from the chat interface.
