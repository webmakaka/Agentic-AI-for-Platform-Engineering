# Chapter 7: Operational Agents and Collaboration

Build a separate agent runtime, add collaborating specialists, then connect them to the existing Chapter 5 Backstage Chat Assistant in Lab 4. The chat UI and route stay the same. Three agents diagnose application problems and propose repairs through GitOps:

- **Platform Coordinator** understands the request, delegates work, and explains the result.
- **Cluster Diagnostics Agent** reads live Kubernetes state to investigate the problem.
- **GitOps Change Agent** reads the application manifest and proposes an image-change PR.

The agents share a runtime, with separate prompts and tools. The coordinator manages the handoffs; MCP servers provide access to platform tools. Lab 2 runs the [Kubernetes MCP server](https://github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server) directly in read-only mode. Lab 3 connects the GitOps specialist directly to [GitHub’s official MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server).

All workload changes follow **Git branch → PR → human review and merge → ArgoCD**. Cluster access is read-only. A PR hook checks proposal conventions, while Langfuse traces and audit records make the agents’ work visible. After deployment, a follow-up request verifies recovery.

## Labs

Reuse the Chapter 5 kind cluster, Backstage app, components repository, and ArgoCD setup. The example application is `my-first-app` in namespace `my-first-app`.

| Lab | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| [0 — Prerequisites](0-prereqs/README.md) | Check the platform and repository settings |
| [1 — Runtime](1-strands-runtime/README.md) | Deploy the Strands agent service |
| [2 — Diagnostics](2-cluster-diagnostics/README.md) | Add the cluster diagnostics specialist |
| [3 — GitOps and collaboration](3-gitops-mcp/README.md) | Connect the agents and propose repair PRs |
| [4 — Backstage chat](4-backstage-collaboration/README.md) | Connect the existing Chat Assistant |
| [5 — Observability](5-langfuse-audit/README.md) | Inspect traces and audit records |

Chapter 7 focuses on collaboration using shared service credentials. Chapter 8 adds mandatory guardrails, an approved MCP catalog, OPA authorization, verified user identity, and tenant isolation.
