# Chapter 04: Driving Platform Intelligence with Organizational Knowledge

Chapter 4 is about a single idea: a model is only as good as the **context** you give it. This chapter turns that idea into running code. You'll take a pile of organizational knowledge — runbooks, postmortems, blueprints — and make it *consumable by AI* two different ways, then see exactly where each one wins.

Everything here runs on the same local **kind** cluster from [`00-cluster-setup`](../00-cluster-setup/README.md). No managed cloud services, no Kinesis, no OpenSearch — you build the whole thing on your laptop and watch it work.

> **Why local?** Earlier drafts pointed readers at a finished AWS reference architecture (Fluent Bit → Kinesis → Lambda → OpenSearch → Bedrock). It's a great production pattern, but you can't *build it as you read*. This chapter builds the same concepts — RAG and MCP over platform knowledge — from scratch, locally. The AWS architecture remains the production-scale reference; this is the version you can run tonight.

## The two techniques, side by side

| | **RAG** (Lab 2) | **MCP** (Lab 3) |
|---|---|---|
| Answers | "What usually happens / how was it solved before?" | "What is true right now?" |
| Source | A corpus of durable docs, embedded into a vector store | A live system, queried on demand |
| Freshness | As fresh as your last ingest | Always current |
| Best for | Runbooks, postmortems, standards, design wisdom | Deployments in progress, cluster health, live signals |

The chapter's punchline — *RAG for accumulated wisdom, MCP for live system truth* — is something you'll feel directly: in Lab 2 you ask "why does a pod end up in CrashLoopBackOff?" and get an answer grounded in your runbooks; in Lab 3 you ask "which deployments are unhealthy *right now*?" and get the answer from the live cluster.

## Labs

| Lab | What you build | Chapter section |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Prerequisites** | Cluster + Python + (optional) LLM credentials | — |
| **1 — Knowledge corpus** | A small, *structured* body of organizational knowledge: runbooks, a postmortem, platform blueprints | §4.4–4.8 (Organizational Knowledge Systems) |
| **2 — Local RAG pipeline** | Postgres + pgvector in-cluster, an ingestion step that embeds the corpus, and a retrieval+generation API that answers platform questions grounded in it | §4.9 (Implementing RAG Systems) |
| **3 — MCP server** | A `list_deployments` MCP server (the §4.10 example, made real) that queries the live cluster — RAG vs MCP, demonstrated | §4.10 (Why MCP matters) |

## Defaults

- **Cluster:** the shared kind cluster from [`00-cluster-setup`](../00-cluster-setup/README.md). ArgoCD is **not** required for this chapter — `SKIP_ARGOCD=1 ./setup-cluster.sh` is enough. (GitOps deployment is introduced in Chapter 5.)
- **Embeddings:** a small local model via [`fastembed`](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`, runs on CPU, no cloud credentials). Amazon Titan embeddings are a documented option.
- **Generation LLM:** Amazon Bedrock with Claude by default; Anthropic API direct as a fallback — the same pattern Chapter 7 uses.

Override any of these via environment variables documented in each lab's README.
